					<h5>Welcome to FurryAvalon!</h5>
					<small>Created by Keiro on March 30th, 2014</small>
					<p>It's been a while since we posted an update, but it was long over-due. Our website's design has been rendered down to the most basic and simplest form of our website.<br><br>Why, do you ask?<br><br>Good question. It's for two reasons -- first and foremost, the lack of developers. I myself am a Systems Administrator. I am not a back-end developer, nor am I a front-end developer. I maintain systems. That is my thing, ergo I have not had much luck in finding someone willing to work with myself and with a friend, Karros.<br><br> Secondly, however, we are only two persons and we need more help in enabling the functionality that we want to provide. We have plans. Oh yes, lots of plans for FurryAvalon. We need your help in bringing that plan to fruition. You can see what we want to do at <a href="https://trello.com/b/Af8WvtkP/furryavalon">Trello</a>. If you know anyone that can help us with bringing our vision to life, we would like to talk to them!</p>
					<p>That said, I'd like to say on behalf of myself and Karros, creator of Dragonfox Studios, a warm thank you for coming to check out our website and what we have currently available.</p>
					<h5>An Update on the Site</h5>
					<small>Created by Keiro on May 5th, 2014</small>
					<p>The header links have been updated accordingly to more closely fit what we have available. However, I'd like to note that at this time, the Forums is inaccessible to everyone but myself and Karros until we feel that the forums is ready to accept users and the like.</p>
