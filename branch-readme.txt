This is our guideline for how to use the various branches.

Trunk/Master: Stable code that has been verified to run correctly and not crash.

Design: Design elements that will be used for the UI/UX of FurryAvalon.

Devel: This is developmental code. As such, use at your own risk.

Development: Leading-edge code that're highly untested; may crash server and/or services.

As for pushing code into the various branches, there's some rules to follow.

Any changes you make, please, for the love of all that's good and sane for us... COMMENT every file you commit to our branches. Basically, in other words, if you want to explain what's in a given file but you don't want to make it too bloated, you add a pointer to the comment file.

For exmaple:

/* For more information on this code, please see filename.derp */

This will allow us to easily backtrack and find bugs as we go along.

That's all for now.
