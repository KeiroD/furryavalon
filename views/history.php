				<h5>History of FurryAvalon.net</h5>
					<small>Created by Keiro on June 3rd, 2015</small>
					<p>FurryAvalon is not actually my creation. I took over FurryAvalon.net from Tricksta on <a href="http://furaffinity.net">FurAffinity.net</a>.
					<br><br>Why, do you ask?<br><br>At the time, I had met Tricksta via I believe IRC or one of my associates. Eventually we got around to talking about the website and the fact that they could no longer devote full attention to FurryAvalon. 
					I suggested that I could take over and bring FurryAvalon to life. Back and forth we went as I demonstrated my capability of handling a website. We eventually transferred control of the domain to myself and I made sure we had transferred all the data.
					<br><br> Unfortunately, after the process had completed, it took some time before I was able to really get into the engine that was FurryAvalon's website. I quickly realized why Tricksta could no longer focus on his project and the difficulties I would face in realizing Tricksta's dream.</p>
					<p>At some point between the transfer and now as of this time of writing, we lost all the images that FurryAvalon users had uploaded in the past. I was unable to recover the images as our backups were corrupted due to a server crash.</p>
					<h5>Who is Chainsaw Chuck?</h5>
					<p>He is FurryAvalon's new mascot, created by Buckthorn!</p>
