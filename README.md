We will be rolling out site code here. To do that, you must have your own Github account, and request access from Keiro Dreamwalker. He will be the one to control access to the repository, whereas Tark, FurryAvalon Lead Developer will commit code to this repository to ensure that we have a back-up copy of site code; this is in addition to having the ability to roll back to an older copy of our code at any given time.

Contact us at http://furryavalon.net if you have any questions or concerns.
